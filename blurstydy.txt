Gaussian blur and median blur are both image filtering techniques used in image processing and computer vision, but they work in different ways and have distinct characteristics:

Gaussian Blur:

Gaussian blur is a type of linear filter that is used to reduce high-frequency noise and create a smoother, more visually appealing image.
It operates by convolving the image with a Gaussian kernel. The Gaussian kernel is a bell-shaped function that assigns more weight to pixels closer to the center of the kernel and less weight to pixels farther away.
The degree of blurring is controlled by the standard deviation (sigma) of the Gaussian kernel. A larger sigma value results in a wider and stronger blur.
Gaussian blur is effective at reducing noise and preserving edges to some extent, but it may still slightly blur fine details.
Median Blur:

Median blur is a nonlinear filter that is primarily used to remove salt-and-pepper noise from an image.
It operates by replacing the value of each pixel with the median value of the pixel values within a local neighborhood (defined by a square or rectangular kernel). This process effectively removes outliers (bright or dark pixels) that are caused by noise.
Median blur is especially useful when dealing with images that have impulsive noise, as it tends to preserve edges and fine details better than Gaussian blur.
However, median blur does not smooth the image as uniformly as Gaussian blur, so it may not be suitable for reducing low-frequency noise or achieving a general smoothing effect.
In summary, the key difference lies in their operation:

Gaussian blur is a linear filter that smooths the image by averaging pixel values based on a weighted sum, which is controlled by a Gaussian kernel. It is suitable for reducing general noise and achieving a soft, uniform blur.

Median blur is a nonlinear filter that replaces each pixel's value with the median value in a local neighborhood, making it robust against impulsive noise while preserving edges and fine details. It is primarily used for noise reduction rather than general smoothing.
