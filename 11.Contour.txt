Applying cv2.findContours()
cv2.findContours(image, Retrieval Mode, Approximation Method)

Retrieval Modes

RETR_LIST - Retrieves all the contours, but doesn't create any parent-child relationship. Parents and kids are equal under this rule, and they are just contours. ie they all belongs to same hierarchy level.
RETR_EXTERNAL - eturns only extreme outer flags. All child contours are left behind.
RETR_CCOMP - This flag retrieves all the contours and arranges them to a 2-level hierarchy. ie external contours of the object (ie its boundary) are placed in hierarchy-1. And the contours of holes inside object (if any) is placed in hierarchy-2. If any object inside it, its contour is placed again in hierarchy-1 only. And its hole in hierarchy-2 and so on.
RETR_TREE - It retrieves all the contours and creates a full family hierarchy list.
Approximation Method Options

cv2.CHAIN_APPROX_NONE – Stores all the points along the line(inefficient!)
cv2.CHAIN_APPROX_SIMPLE – Stores the end points of each line

NOTE: For findContours to work, the background has to be black and foreground (i.e. the text or objects)
Otherwise you'll need to invert the image by using cv2..bitwise_not(input_image)

Remember these Countouring Steps
Grayscale
Threshold or Canny Edge Detection to Binarize image
Note: Blurring before Step 2 is recommended to remove noisy contours

Hierachry

This array stores 4 values for each contour:

First term is the index of the Next contour
Second term is the index of the Previous contour
Third term is the index of the parent contour
Forth term is the index of the child contour

Approximating Contours using ApproxPolyDP
Using ApproxPolyDP to approximate contours as a more defined shape
It approximates a contour shape to another shape with less number of vertices depending upon the precision we specify.

cv2.approxPolyDP(contour, Approximation Accuracy, Closed)

contour – is the individual contour we wish to approximate
Approximation Accuracy – Important parameter is determining the accuracy of the approximation. Small values give precise- approximations, large values give more generic approximation. A good rule of thumb is less than 5% of the contour perimeter
Closed – a Boolean value that states whether the approximate contour should be open or closed

## **Convex Hull**

Convex Hull will look similar to contour approximation, but it is not (Both may provide the same results in some cases). 

The cv2.convexHull() function checks a curve for convexity defects and corrects it. Generally speaking, convex curves are the curves which are always bulged out, or at-least flat. And if it is bulged inside, it is called convexity defects. For example, check the below image of hand. Red line shows the convex hull of hand. The double-sided arrow marks shows the convexity defects, which are the local maximum deviations of hull from contours
