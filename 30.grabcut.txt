Grab Cut Work?
User inputs the rectangle. Everything outside this rectangle will be taken as the background. Everything inside rectangle is unknown.
The algorithm labels the foreground and background pixels (or it hard-labels)
Next a Gaussian Mixture Model(GMM) is used to model the foreground and background.
Depending on the data we gave, GMM learns and create new pixel distribution. That is, the unknown pixels are labelled either probable foreground or probable background depending on its relation with the other hard-labelled pixels in terms of color statistics (It is just like clustering).
A graph is built from this pixel distribution. Nodes in the graphs are pixels. Additional two nodes are added, Source node and Sink node. Every foreground pixel is connected to Source node and every background pixel is connected to Sink node.
The weights of edges connecting pixels to source node/end node are defined by the probability of a pixel being foreground/background. The weights between the pixels are defined by the edge information or pixel similarity. If there is a large difference in pixel color, the edge between them will get a low weight. = Then a mincut algorithm is used to segment the graph. It cuts the graph into two separating source node and sink node with minimum cost function. The cost function is the sum of all weights of the edges that are cut. After the cut, all the pixels connected to Source node become foreground and those connected to Sink node become background.
The process is continued until the classification converges.

Grabcut Arguments
img - Input image
mask - It is a mask image where we specify which areas are background, foreground or probable background/foreground etc. It is done by the following flags, cv.GC_BGD, cv.GC_FGD, cv.GC_PR_BGD, cv.GC_PR_FGD, or simply pass 0,1,2,3 to image.
rect - It is the coordinates of a rectangle which includes the foreground object in the format (x,y,w,h)
bdgModel, fgdModel - These are arrays used by the algorithm internally. You just create two np.float64 type zero arrays of size (1,65).
iterCount - Number of iterations the algorithm should run.
mode - It should be cv.GC_INIT_WITH_RECT or cv.GC_INIT_WITH_MASK or combined which decides whether we are drawing rectangle or final touchup strokes
