QR Code Generation
Let's generate QR Codes using our qrcode package.

A QR code (abbreviated from Quick Response code) is a type of matrix barcode (or two-dimensional barcode) first designed in 1994 for the automotive industry in Japan. A barcode is a machine-readable optical label that contains information about the item to which it is attached. In practice, QR codes often contain data for a locator, identifier, or tracker that points to a website or application. A QR code uses four standardized encoding modes (numeric, alphanumeric, byte/binary, and kanji) to store data efficiently; extensions may also be used.

A QR code consists of black squares arranged in a square grid on a white background, which can be read by an imaging device such as a camera, and processed using Reed–Solomon error correction until the image can be appropriately interpreted. The required data is then extracted from patterns that are present in both horizontal and vertical components of the image.

Configuartion for QR Codes:

version — Control the size of the QR Code. It accepts an integer from 1 to 40. Version 1 consists of 21 x 21 matrix.
error_correction — Control the error correction used for the QR Code.
box_size — Control the number of pixels of each boxes of the QR code.
border — Control the boxes thickness of the border. The default is value is 4 which is also the minimum value according to the specification.
There are 4 constants available for error_correction. The higher errors can be corrected, the better it is.

ERROR_CORRECT_L — About 7% or less errors can be corrected.
ERROR_CORRECT_M — About 15% or less errors can be corrected. This is the default value.
ERROR_CORRECT_Q — About 25% or less errors can be corrected.
ERROR_CORRECT_H — About 30% or less errors can be corrected.
